# **PID Controller** 

**PID Controller Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Implement the PID controller as taught in lesson 16 "PID Control"
* Tune the PID controller parameters such that the vehicle safely drives through the simulated race track
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points

Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/824/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

## Implementation of PID Controller

#### Effect of P component

See [video](./P_video.mp4)...

#### Effect of D component

See [video](./PD_video.mp4)...

#### Effect of I component

See [video](./PID_video.mp4)...

## Parameter tuning

I chose twiddle, see lines...
